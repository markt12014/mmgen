#### Perform the following steps on both your online and offline computers:

Install required Debian/Ubuntu packages:

	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf git libgmp-dev libssl-dev libpcre3-dev libtool wipe
	$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-ecdsa python3-pexpect python3-setuptools python3-cryptography python3-nacl python3-pip python3-gmpy2 python3-sha3

Using the [pip3][P] installer, install the Python scrypt library:

	$ sudo -H pip3 install scrypt

Install the secp256k1 library:

	$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git
	$ cd secp256k1
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ sudo ldconfig
	$ cd ..

Install MMGen:

	$ git clone https://github.com/mmgen/mmgen.git
	$ cd mmgen
	$ git checkout stable_linux # see 'Note' below
	$ sudo ./setup.py install
	$ cd ..

**Note:** if you want to use features that have appeared since the latest
`stable_linux` release, then you can omit the `git checkout` step and remain on
the `master` branch.  But though the tip of `master` is always tested on Linux
before being pushed to the public repository, please be aware that security
vulnerabilities are more likely to be present in new code than in a stable
release.  In addition, new code may require dependencies or installation steps
not yet covered in the documentation.

Install your coin daemon(s).  To install prebuilt binaries, go [here][01].  To
install from source, go [here][02].

#### *Note for offline machines:*

> Naturally, your offline machine must be connected to the Internet to retrieve
> and install the above packages as described above.  This is normally not a
> problem, as you can simply take the machine offline permanently after the
> install is done, preferably removing or disabling its network interfaces.

> However, if your machine is already offline and you wish to leave it that way,
> or if it lacks a network interface entirely, then youâ€™ll need to take roughly
> the following steps:

>> If your offline and offline machines have the same architecture, then just
>> download the Debian/Ubuntu packages and their dependencies on your online
>> machine using `apt-get download`.  Otherwise, you must download the packages
>> manually from `packages.debian.org` or `packages.ubuntu.com`.
>>
>> Download the Python packages using `pip3 download`.
>>
>> Transfer the downloaded files and cloned Git repositories to your offline
>> computer using a USB stick or other removable medium.  Install the
>> Debian/Ubuntu packages with `sudo dpkg -i` and the Python packages with `pip3
>> install`.  Install MMGen and the secp256k1 library from the copied Git
>> repositories as described above.

Congratulations, your installation is now complete!  Now proceed to [**Getting
Started with MMGen**][gs].
